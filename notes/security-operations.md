# 🔍 **Security Operations: Incident Management & Threat Response**

Security Operations (SecOps) involves **continuous monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and remediation** to ensure the security of an organization's systems and data. A well-structured security operations framework helps mitigate cyber threats and enhance resilience.

## 📌 **1. Key Components of Security Operations**

### 🔹 **1.1 Security Operations Center (SOC)**
> The SOC is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.

✅ Implements **real-time threat monitoring** via **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)**.  
✅ Operates **24/7 to handle cybersecurity threats** proactively.  
✅ Utilizes tools such as **Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight, ELK Stack** for log analysis.

### 🔹 **1.2 Incident Response & Handling**
> Organizations must have an effective **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** to mitigate and recover from security breaches.

| **Phase** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Preparation** | Establish security policies, playbooks, and response teams. |
| **2. Detection & Analysis** | Monitor logs, SIEM alerts, and behavioral analytics for anomalies. |
| **3. Containment** | Isolate affected systems and prevent further damage. |
| **4. Eradication** | Remove malicious software, patch vulnerabilities, and secure endpoints. |
| **5. Recovery** | Restore systems, verify security posture, and resume operations. |
| **6. Lessons Learned** | Conduct post-incident review and improve defenses. |

✅ Use **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** to analyze adversary tactics and techniques.  
✅ Leverage **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** for automated threat handling.

### 🔹 **1.3 Threat Intelligence & Hunting**
> **Proactive threat intelligence gathering** helps in identifying and preventing cyber threats before they escalate.

✅ Monitor **Threat Intelligence Feeds** (AlienVault OTX, IBM X-Force, FireEye).  
✅ Conduct **Threat Hunting** using **YARA rules**, behavioral analytics, and **endpoint detection** tools.  
✅ Implement **IOC (Indicators of Compromise) and TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** analysis.

## 🚨 **2. Common Security Threats & Countermeasures**

| Threat | Description | Mitigation Strategies |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Phishing Attacks** | Fraudulent emails trick users into revealing credentials. | Implement **email filtering**, conduct **user awareness training**. |
| **Ransomware** | Malware encrypts files and demands payment. | Use **backup strategies**, deploy **EDR solutions**, apply **network segmentation**. |
| **Insider Threats** | Malicious activity from employees or contractors. | Enforce **least privilege access**, use **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**. |
| **DDoS Attacks** | Flooding a network to disrupt service availability. | Deploy **traffic filtering**, use **CDN-based protection**, configure **rate-limiting**. |
| **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** | Long-term, stealthy cyber intrusions. | Implement **Zero Trust security**, utilize **behavioral anomaly detection**. |

## 🔑 **3. Security Monitoring & Logging**

### 🔹 **3.1 SIEM & Log Analysis**
> **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)** solutions collect and analyze security logs to detect threats.

✅ **Collect logs** from firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint security, and authentication servers.  
✅ Use **correlation rules** to detect abnormal behavior patterns.  
✅ Implement **real-time alerting** for incident detection.

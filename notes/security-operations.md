# 🔍 **Security Operations: Incident Management & Threat Response**

Security Operations (SecOps) involves **continuous monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and remediation** to ensure the security of an organization's systems and data. A well-structured security operations framework helps mitigate cyber threats and enhance resilience.

## 📌 **1. Key Components of Security Operations**

### 🔹 **1.1 Security Operations Center (SOC)**
> The SOC is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.

✅ Implements **real-time threat monitoring** via **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)**.  
✅ Operates **24/7 to handle cybersecurity threats** proactively.  
✅ Utilizes tools such as **Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight, ELK Stack** for log analysis.

### 🔹 **1.2 Incident Response & Handling**
> Organizations must have an effective **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** to mitigate and recover from security breaches.

| **Phase** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Preparation** | Establish security policies, playbooks, and response teams. |
| **2. Detection & Analysis** | Monitor logs, SIEM alerts, and behavioral analytics for anomalies. |
| **3. Containment** | Isolate affected systems and prevent further damage. |
| **4. Eradication** | Remove malicious software, patch vulnerabilities, and secure endpoints. |
| **5. Recovery** | Restore systems, verify security posture, and resume operations. |
| **6. Lessons Learned** | Conduct post-incident review and improve defenses. |

✅ Use **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** to analyze adversary tactics and techniques.  
✅ Leverage **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** for automated threat handling.

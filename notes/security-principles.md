# 🔐 **Security Principles**

Security principles serve as the foundation of **cybersecurity**, ensuring the **protection of information systems** from unauthorized access, disruption, or destruction. These principles guide the design, implementation, and management of secure systems.

## 📌 **1. The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

The **CIA Triad** represents the core objectives of cybersecurity:

| Principle        | Description | Examples |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. | **Encryption** (AES, TLS), **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** |
| **Integrity** | Maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness of data, preventing unauthorized modification. | **Digital Signatures**, **Hashing (SHA-256, MD5)**, **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** |
| **Availability** | Ensuring that resources remain accessible to authorized users when needed. | **Load Balancing**, **Redundant Servers**, **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plans** |

> **🔹 Example:** Banks use **encryption** to protect customer transactions (Confidentiality), **hashing** to verify data integrity, and **server redundancy** to ensure availability.

## 🔐 **2. Security Principles in Practice**

Beyond the **CIA Triad**, several essential security principles ensure strong cybersecurity defenses:

# 🔐 **Security Principles**

Security principles serve as the foundation of **cybersecurity**, ensuring the **protection of information systems** from unauthorized access, disruption, or destruction. These principles guide the design, implementation, and management of secure systems.

## 📌 **1. The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

The **CIA Triad** represents the core objectives of cybersecurity:

| Principle        | Description | Examples |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. | **Encryption** (AES, TLS), **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** |
| **Integrity** | Maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness of data, preventing unauthorized modification. | **Digital Signatures**, **Hashing (SHA-256, MD5)**, **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** |
| **Availability** | Ensuring that resources remain accessible to authorized users when needed. | **Load Balancing**, **Redundant Servers**, **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plans** |

> **🔹 Example:** Banks use **encryption** to protect customer transactions (Confidentiality), **hashing** to verify data integrity, and **server redundancy** to ensure availability.

## 🔐 **2. Security Principles in Practice**

Beyond the **CIA Triad**, several essential security principles ensure strong cybersecurity defenses:

### ✅ **Least Privilege**
> **Users and systems should have the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.**
- 🔹 Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- 🔹 Restrict admin privileges to essential personnel
- 🔹 Regularly review **access permissions**

### ✅ **Defense in Depth**
> **A multi-layered security strategy minimizes attack risks.**
- 🔹 Use **firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, and encryption** together
- 🔹 Employ **multi-layer authentication** (e.g., MFA + biometrics)
- 🔹 Combine **network segmentation and intrusion monitoring**

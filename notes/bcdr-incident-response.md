# 🛡️ **Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery & Incident Response**

Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) and Incident Response (IR) are essential components of an organization's cybersecurity strategy. They ensure operational resilience, data integrity, and prompt response to security incidents.

## 📌 **1. Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**

**Business Continuity Planning (BCP)** focuses on keeping critical business operations running during and after a disruptive event.

### 🔹 **Key BCP Components:**
- **Risk Assessment** – Identify potential threats (cyberattacks, natural disasters, system failures).
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** – Determine the impact of disruptions on business operations.
- **Continuity Strategies** – Establish backup systems, redundant networks, and remote work capabilities.
- **Communication Plan** – Define protocols for internal and external communications during a crisis.
- **Training & Testing** – Conduct regular drills, tabletop exercises, and employee awareness programs.

> **Example:** A financial institution implements a secondary data center with real-time replication to ensure business continuity in case of a primary site failure.

## 🔥 **2. Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning**

**Disaster Recovery (DR)** focuses on restoring IT infrastructure and systems after a disruptive event.

### 🔹 **Disaster Recovery Strategies:**
- **Data Backup & Recovery** – Regular backups (onsite, offsite, cloud-based) with automated recovery mechanisms.
- **Redundant Systems** – Use mirrored servers, failover clusters, and geographic dispersion.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** – Define acceptable downtime and data loss.
- **Incident Logging & Reporting** – Maintain records of incidents for forensic investigation.
- **Testing & Simulation** – Periodically test recovery processes to validate effectiveness.

> **Example:** An e-commerce platform has a DR plan with **RTO = 2 hours** and **RPO = 15 minutes**, ensuring quick recovery with minimal data loss.

## 🚨 **3. Incident Response (IR) Framework**

**Incident Response (IR)** is a structured approach for detecting, containing, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents.

### 🔹 **Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST SP 800-61)**

| Phase | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Preparation** | Establish incident response policies, tools, and team training. |
| **2. Detection & Analysis** | Identify security incidents via monitoring (SIEM, IDS/IPS). |
| **3. Containment** | Limit the impact by isolating affected systems. |
| **4. Eradication** | Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, and strengthen defenses. |
| **5. Recovery** | Restore affected systems and verify normal operations. |
| **6. Lessons Learned** | Conduct post-incident reviews and update response plans. |

> **Example:** A SOC team detects unusual network activity through **SIEM alerts** and follows an IR playbook to contain and mitigate the incident.

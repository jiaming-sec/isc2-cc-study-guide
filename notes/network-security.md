# 🌐 **Network Security: Principles, Threats, and Best Practices**

Network security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data, systems, and communications from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and attacks. A robust network security framework ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** (CIA Triad) of digital assets.

## 📌 **1. Key Concepts in Network Security**

### 🔹 **1.1 Defense in Depth**
> Implementing multiple layers of security to reduce attack surface and mitigate threats.

✅ Use **firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), endpoint protection, and access control**.  
✅ Ensure **network segmentation** to isolate sensitive data and systems.  
✅ Deploy **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for enhanced access control.

### 🔹 **1.2 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**
> "Never trust, always verify."

✅ Authenticate every user, device, and session request before granting access.  
✅ Continuously monitor user behavior and enforce **least privilege access**.  
✅ Utilize **micro-segmentation** to prevent lateral movement within the network.

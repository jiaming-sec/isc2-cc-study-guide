## 🛡️ **4. Threats & Attacks**

**Q:** What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?  
**A:** An attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.  

**Q:** What is Phishing?  
**A:** A social engineering attack that tricks users into providing sensitive information.  

**Q:** What is Ransomware?  
**A:** Malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment for decryption.  

**Q:** What is SQL Injection?  
**A:** An attack where malicious SQL code is injected into a database query to manipulate data.  

**Q:** What is a Zero-Day Exploit?  
**A:** An attack targeting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor.  

**Q:** What is a Logic Bomb?  
**A:** A malicious script that executes when certain conditions are met.

**Q:** What is AES?  
**A:** Advanced Encryption Standard; a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.  

**Q:** What is RSA?  
**A:** A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission.  

**Q:** What is hashing?  
**A:** A one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-length hash value.  

**Q:** What is the purpose of a digital signature?  
**A:** To verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document using cryptographic techniques.

**Q:** What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?  
**A:** A security model that restricts system access based on user roles and responsibilities.  

**Q:** What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?  
**A:** A security mechanism requiring two or more authentication factors to verify a user's identity.  

**Q:** What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?

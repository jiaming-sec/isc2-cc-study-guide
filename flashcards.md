## 🌐 **3. Network Security**

**Q:** What is the purpose of a firewall?  
**A:** A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.  

**Q:** What are the types of firewalls?  
**A:** Packet filtering, Stateful inspection, Proxy-based, Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW).  

**Q:** What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?  
**A:** A security tool that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.

## 🛡️ **4. Threats & Attacks**

**Q:** What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?  
**A:** An attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.  

**Q:** What is Phishing?  
**A:** A social engineering attack that tricks users into providing sensitive information.  

**Q:** What is Ransomware?  
**A:** Malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment for decryption.  

**Q:** What is SQL Injection?

## ⚙️ **6. Cryptography**

**Q:** What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?  
**A:** Symmetric encryption uses a single key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public-private key pair.  

**Q:** What is AES?  
**A:** Advanced Encryption Standard; a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.  

**Q:** What is RSA?  
**A:** A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission.  

**Q:** What is hashing?  
**A:** A one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-length hash value.  

**Q:** What is the purpose of a digital signature?  
**A:** To verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document using cryptographic techniques.

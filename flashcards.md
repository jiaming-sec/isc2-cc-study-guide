**Q:** What are the three components of the CIA Triad?  
**A:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.  

**Q:** What is the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)?  
**A:** Users should be granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.  

**Q:** What is Defense in Depth?  
**A:** A layered security strategy that implements multiple protective measures at different levels.

## 🌐 **3. Network Security**

**Q:** What is the purpose of a firewall?  
**A:** A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.  

**Q:** What are the types of firewalls?  
**A:** Packet filtering, Stateful inspection, Proxy-based, Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW).  

**Q:** What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?  
**A:** A security tool that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.  

**Q:** How does a VPN enhance network security?  
**A:** A VPN encrypts internet traffic, ensuring secure communication over untrusted networks.

## 🛡️ **4. Threats & Attacks**

**Q:** What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?  
**A:** An attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.  

**Q:** What is Phishing?  
**A:** A social engineering attack that tricks users into providing sensitive information.  

**Q:** What is Ransomware?  
**A:** Malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment for decryption.  

**Q:** What is SQL Injection?  
**A:** An attack where malicious SQL code is injected into a database query to manipulate data.  

**Q:** What is a Zero-Day Exploit?  
**A:** An attack targeting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor.

**A:** 1. Preparation, 2. Detection & Analysis, 3. Containment, 4. Eradication, 5. Recovery, 6. Lessons Learned.  

**Q:** What is SIEM?  
**A:** Security Information and Event Management; a tool used to aggregate and analyze security logs.  

**Q:** What are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)?  
**A:** Evidence that a system or network has been breached, such as unusual outbound traffic or login anomalies.  

**Q:** What is SOAR?  
**A:** Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response; used to automate incident response processes.

## ⚙️ **6. Cryptography**

**Q:** What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?  
**A:** Symmetric encryption uses a single key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public-private key pair.  

**Q:** What is AES?  
**A:** Advanced Encryption Standard; a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.  

**Q:** What is RSA?  
**A:** A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission.  

**Q:** What is hashing?  
**A:** A one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-length hash value.  

**Q:** What is the purpose of a digital signature?  
**A:** To verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document using cryptographic techniques.

## 🖥️ **7. Authentication & Access Control**

**Q:** What are the factors of authentication?  
**A:** 1. Something You Know (Password), 2. Something You Have (Security Token), 3. Something You Are (Biometrics).  

**Q:** What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?  
**A:** A security model that restricts system access based on user roles and responsibilities.  

**Q:** What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?  
**A:** A security mechanism requiring two or more authentication factors to verify a user's identity.  

**Q:** What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?  
**A:** A method that allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications.
